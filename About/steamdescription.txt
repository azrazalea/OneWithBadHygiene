Compatibility patch between One With Death and Dubs Bad Hygiene.

[h1]Effects[/h1]
[list]
[*] Undead are exempt from hygiene, bladder, and thirst needs (they're dead)
[*] Necromancers with FamiliarWithDeath or OneWithDeath are exempt from bladder and thirst
[*] OneWithDeath necromancers are also exempt from hygiene
[*] Adds hygiene decay rate modifiers for necromancer progression stages until exempt (stench of death)
[/list]

This patch works regardless of DBH's "Override Need Definitions" setting being enabled.

Also includes debug actions for testing necromancy states (merged into OWD's debug menu):
[list]
[*] Set Unfamiliar/Familiar With Death
[*] Make Lich (One With Death)
