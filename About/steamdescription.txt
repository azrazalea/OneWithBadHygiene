Compatibility patch between One With Death and Dubs Bad Hygiene.

[h1]Effects[/h1]
[list]
[*] Undead are exempt from hygiene, bladder, and thirst needs (they're dead)
[*] Necromancers with FamiliarWithDeath or OneWithDeath are exempt from bladder and thirst
[*] OneWithDeath necromancers are also exempt from hygiene
[*] Adds hygiene decay rate modifiers for necromancer progression stages until exempt (stench of death)
[/list]

This patch works regardless of DBH's "Override Need Definitions" setting being enabled.

[h1]Optional Enhancement (Settings Menu)[/h1]
Enable "Necromancer Progression Effects" for a more immersive experience:
[list]
[*] Gradual stat/need changes through progression stages
[*] Matches lore descriptions (UnfamiliarWithDeath now actually reduces hunger/rest as stated)
[*] Pain resistance, toxic immunity, temperature tolerance, consciousness, learning, psychic sensitivity
[*] Movement speed and melee improvements at higher stages
[*] DBH integration: hygiene decays faster, bladder/thirst fade with other biological needs
[*] Accelerated aging: body decays faster as it embraces death (10% → 20% → 40% → disabled as lich)
[/list]
[b]Note:[/b] This setting is OFF by default. Changing it requires restarting RimWorld (XML-based patches).

[h1]Debug Actions[/h1]
Also includes debug actions for testing necromancy states (merged into OWD's debug menu):
[list]
[*] Set Unfamiliar/Familiar With Death
[*] Make Lich (One With Death)
[*] Promote/Demote Necromancy Rank
[*] Clear Necromancy State
[/list]
